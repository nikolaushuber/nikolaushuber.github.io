My name is Nikolaus Huber, and I am currently pursuing a PhD in computer science at Uppsala University. 

My research is mostly about realtime software, and its applications within safety-critical systems ranging from small health-care devices to autonomous vehicles and satellites. 

I started this website as a personal collection of the things I kind of do on the side during my day job. Quite often I find myself in a position, where I need to look a bit deeper into certain programming languages, certain hardware architectures, or sometimes even just some interesting papers that are not directly linked to my research, but that I would still like to present in some way. This website is that outlet for me. 

If you find any errors, have suggestions, or just want to chat, you can always write me an [e-mail](mailto:mail@n-huber.eu).

I see it as a great accomplishment of our time, that we have realized the need to strive for a more inclusive environment.

## Privacy 

Privacy and ownership of our personal data is a growing concern. I have therefore decided to forego the (quite abundant) integration of profiling frameworks which collect data from the end user. I instead use a framework called [Plausible](https://plausible.io/). As you can see from their website, Plausible does not use cookies and does not collect personal data. It is compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and PECR. Therefore, you have not seen a üç™ banner when you first opened this webpage! 

This page is brought to you through GitHub pages. You can have a look at their privacy statement [here](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement)

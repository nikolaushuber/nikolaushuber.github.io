My name is Nikolaus Huber, and I am currently pursuing a PhD in computer science at Uppsala University. 

My research is mostly about realtime software, and its applications within safety-critical systems ranging from small health-care devices to autonomous vehicles and satellites. 

I started this blog as a personal collection of the things I kind of do on the side during my day job. Quite often I find myself in a position, where I need to look a bit deeper into certain programming languages, certain hardware architectures, or sometimes even just some interesting papers that are not directly linked to my research, but that I would still like to present in some way. This blog is that outlet for me. 

If you find any errors, have suggestions, or just want to chat, you can always write me an [e-mail](mailto:mail@nicks-code.space).

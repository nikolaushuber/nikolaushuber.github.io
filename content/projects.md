## [Zephyr RTOS]() 

> The Zephyr OS is based on a small-footprint kernel designed for use on resource-constrained and embedded systems: from simple embedded environmental sensors and LED wearables to sophisticated embedded controllers, smart watches, and IoT wireless applications. [Zephyr Documentation](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/introduction/index.html)

For my master thesis I wrote the original [SPARC v8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARC) architecture port and board support for the [LEON3](https://www.gaisler.com/index.php/products/processors/leon3) processor. The full text is available [here](http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:ltu:diva-76055).

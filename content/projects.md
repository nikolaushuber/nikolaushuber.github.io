These are some of the projects or software packages I am (or have been) involved in: 

## [Zephyr RTOS]() 

> The Zephyr OS is based on a small-footprint kernel designed for use on resource-constrained and embedded systems: from simple embedded environmental sensors and LED wearables to sophisticated embedded controllers, smart watches, and IoT wireless applications. [Zephyr Documentation](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/introduction/index.html)

For my master thesis I wrote the original [SPARC v8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARC) architecture port and board support for the [LEON3](https://www.gaisler.com/index.php/products/processors/leon3) processor. The full text is available [here](http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:ltu:diva-76055). 


## [Opeg](https://github.com/nikolaushuber/opeg)

As a final project for the PhD level course [FID3006 Compilers and Execution Environments](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/ID2202?l=en) at [KTH](https://www.kth.se) (Stockholm, Sweden) I created a tool called Opeg. Opeg is a PEG parser generator for the OCaml programming language. It can take a grammar expressed as a [parsing expression grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar) (PEG) and turn it into executable OCaml code.
